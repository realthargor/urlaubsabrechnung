Problem:
Imagine you make a holiday trip with your friends or some other people. When you have to pay train tickets, entrance fees or for accommodation it is often a pain collecting the money from everyone. Much more convenient is to just write down, who payed what amount for what purpose. After the end of the trip everyone contributes what he paid.

The goal of this project is an Google AppEngine hosted project allowing users to define accounts and groups that share costs.  Then everyone invited can easily enter the bills he payed. The software creates an report and shows who is in credit or debit.

The project can be tested at http://urlaubsabrechnung.appspot.com/ . Feel free to try the web page.
